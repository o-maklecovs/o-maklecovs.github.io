        <div>
          <p>Hello! My name is Olegs and I'm a Computer Science student at De Montfort University (soon-to-be graduate) and a web developer. I work mainly with JavaScript and Node but I often try to expand my knowledge by learning other languages and technologies. I have some personal experience of building web apps using Node and Express, along with academic experience with PHP and Java, among other skills.</p>
          <p>At the moment I'm looking forward to kickstarting my career in web development. I consider myself a "forever student", even though my time at university is coming to an end I still expect to be learning in the future. This is due to there being many nuances to web development I'm not aware of yet and due to fast-changing world of web technologies.</p>
