        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Hello! My name is Olegs and I'm a recent Computer Science graduate and a web developer. I work mainly with JavaScript and Node but I often try to expand my knowledge by learning other languages and technologies. I have some personal experience of building web apps using Node and Express, along with academic experience with PHP and Java, among other skills.</p>
          <p>At the moment I'm looking forward to kickstarting my career in web development. I consider myself a "forever student". I still expect and looking forward to be learning in the future. This is due to there being many nuances to web development I'm not aware of yet and due to fast-changing world of web technologies.</p>
